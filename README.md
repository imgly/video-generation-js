## Why Use CreativeEditor SDK for Video Generation?

Video is the most effective medium for engagement, making it vital for social media, marketing, and e-commerce platforms. Traditional server-side video generation methods are costly and resource-intensive. CE.SDK bridges this gap, enabling scalable, client-side video creation tailored to modern audiences.
